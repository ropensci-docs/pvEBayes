# Estimate expected null baseline count based on reference row and column

This function estimates the expected null baseline count (\\E\_{ij}\\)
for each AE-drug combination under the assumption of independence
between rows and columns. The expected count is calculated using a
reference row (other AEs) and reference column (other drugs). This null
baseline is typically used in the empirical Bayes modeling of pvEBayes
package for signal detection and estimation in spontaneous reporting
system (SRS) data.

## Usage

``` r
calculate_tilde_e(contin_table)
```

## Arguments

- contin_table:

  an IxJ contingency table showing pairwise counts of adverse events for
  I AEs (along the rows) and J drugs (along the columns). The reference
  row "Other AEs" and the reference column "Other drugs" need to be the
  I-th row and J-th column respectively.

## Value

an `nrow(contin_table)` by `ncol(contin_table)` matrix.

## Details

This null value estimator is proposed by Tan et al. (2025).
